; Louis Reasoner is incorrect. The essential difference between the exchange problem and the transfer problem is that
; the concurrency of the exchange problem caused exchange to operate on past not current values of the accounts. This
; does not exist in the transfer problem because transfer only is concerned with whether or not the account withdrawn
; from has enough funds. Any error in the transfer system is purely human and not caused by a computer.
