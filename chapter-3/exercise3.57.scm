; The number of additions performed when comuting the nth fibonacci number is equal to n. However, the number of additions
; to compute the nth fibonacci number without the memo-proc optimization is equal to phi^n where phi is equal to the golden ratio.
; The reason for this is because the ratio of the number of additions required to compute the nth fibonacci number divided by
; the number of additions required to compute the n-1th fibonacci number approaches phi.
