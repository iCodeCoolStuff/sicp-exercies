No. For very large values of base and e, the amount of memory it would take to store the result of base^e would be very large. Plus, it would take a relatively large amount of time to compute the remainder of such a large value of base^3 mod m.

Previous answer:
No. It would take Theta(n) time to search for the remainder of base^exp and m using fast-exp over expmod.
